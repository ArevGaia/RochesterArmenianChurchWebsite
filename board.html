                <p class = "bio">Vincent Lima (chairperson) is president of Authentic Testing Corp.
                    Vincent was active in the Armenian community of Tehran, where he lived until the age of 19. 
                    While attending the New School in New York City and later, studying under the Alex Manoogian Chair 
                    in Modern Armenian History at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, he was active in the 
                    Armenian Youth Federation; he chaired the Central Executive Board in 1988 and 1989, 
                    at the time of the earthquake in Armenia and the intensification of the Karabakh Movement.
                    Vincent went on to edit the scholarly journal Armenian Review and, 
                    in 1998, co-founded with Ara Sarafian the influential contemporary-affairs journal Armenian Forum.
                    In 2006 Vincent was engaged as editor in chief of the Armenian Reporter and relocated to 
                    Armenia with his partner Martha Boudakian and their young daughters Noor and Arev. 
                    He recruited and led a staff of 15 full-time editors, correspondents, and designers in 
                    Armenia, New York, Los Angeles, and Minnesota, along with scores of freelancers to bring news from 
                    Armenia and local communities in the United States to readers.
                    He moved with his family to Rochester in 2010

                    Yerevan. Education and work took me through Moscow, Pittsburgh,
                    Berkeley and Houston, before eventually bringing me to Rochester
                    which I have been calling home since 2014. Growing up I devoted
                    myself to mathematical competitions, which eventually led to a PhD
                    in mathematics from UC Berkeley, and now I am an Associate
                    Professor of Mathematics at the University of Rochester. My wife
                    Luiza, who is a CPA in a local accounting firm and our two
                    sons Martin and Torgom enjoy going on long bike rides on the Erie Canal trail, and are always excited to join the Armenian
                    community events throughout the year. </p>
