                <p class = "bio">Hi, I am Sevak Mkrtchyan. I was born in Gyumri but grew up in
                    Yerevan. Education and work took me through Moscow, Pittsburgh,
                    Berkeley and Houston, before eventually bringing me to Rochester
                    which I have been calling home since 2014. Growing up I devoted
                    myself to mathematical competitions, which eventually led to a PhD
                    in mathematics from UC Berkeley, and now I am an Associate
                    Professor of Mathematics at the University of Rochester. My wife
                    Luiza, who is a CPA in a local accounting firm and our two
                    sons Martin and Torgom enjoy going on long bike rides on the Erie Canal trail, and are always excited to join the Armenian
                    community events throughout the year. </p>

                    annual church picnic in September. I am 100% Armenian, was raised in Syracuse but have lived in the
                    Rochester area since college. I have a chemistry degree from the University of Rochester and a MBA
                    from Rochester Institute of Technology. I worked at Xerox Corporation for 31 years as a financial analyst
                    and retired in 2021. I was married for 20 years and have a 27 year old son, Connor who is an attorney
                    with a Rochester law firm. In my free time, I enjoy kayaking, yoga, going to the dog park with my rescue
                    dog, Foxy, as well as spending time with my family and friends. </p>
